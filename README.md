Experimenting with new technologies. My goal is to evaluate existing framwork and combine them in a way which 
allows rapid creation of web application. In general I always prefer plain Java based frameworks. 
The reason is that the the Java Script based ones are nice but they are less convenient when it comes to debug, 
lack of decent IDE support, not strongly typed language. I also don't like having descriptors in the code it is hard 
them to keep in synchron with the rest of the application.

Nice web framework purely written in java. Lot of compoments and a visual editor is available.
